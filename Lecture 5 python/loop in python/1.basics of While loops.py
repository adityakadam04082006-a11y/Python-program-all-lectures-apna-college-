# Loops in python 
# loops are used to repeat instructions ,
# there are basically two types of loops (while , for loop)

   # while True : 
   #   print("hello")     ,if we print this then  it will be printed infinite times

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("hello")
    count += 1

    print(count)

    # to run in loop this proccess is called iteration
    # now see we have take count variable to make our condition true so this variable is called iterator
    # see means by which variable we have taken circle around loop is called iterator 
    # and iteration means 1 time we have taken circle around loop and like this going on..
    # this variables are usually like (i,j,k,l) etc. any

    i = 1
    while i <= 10 :
        print("adi",i)
        i += 1

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
    j = 1
while j <= 5:
    print(j)
    j += 1

#  Print numbers 5 to 1 (in reverse)
    k = 5
while k >= 1:
    print(k)
    k -= 1
